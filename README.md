## Soccer Locker

Description: Soccer Locker will aim to provide the most important news about the worldâ€™s most popular sport. It will have results from leagues all around the world. It will also have all the scores from the popular leagues around the world, including live scores. I will also try to implement a section for videos of goals, interviews, and tactical analysis.

## MVP features: 
The website will have containers for match results. For this I will use flexbox because I feel more comfortable with it. 
I will also make sure the app is compatible on mobile and tablet devices first because I expect users to mainly use it on those devices.

## Post-MVP: 
I would like to implement videos, links to articles, and a database of matches (both completed and live) that displays tactical analysis of each match.
